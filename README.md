## 🚀 Overview

**Operators know things before investors do** — but there's no incentive-compatible, scalable way to surface that knowledge.

NorthFall bridges the gap between expert insight and capital allocation through prediction markets powered by Kalshi's regulated infrastructure. We turn on-the-ground knowledge into actionable investment signals.

### The Problem

Investors struggle to identify promising startups early. Traditional sourcing methods are:

- **Expensive** — Manual scouting and fragmented research drain resources
- **Slow** — Personal networks and referrals create bottlenecks  
- **Incomplete** — The best signals often come from operators who lack direct channels to investors

Meanwhile, domain experts and operators possess valuable, real-time insight about emerging companies — but there's no efficient mechanism to connect that knowledge to capital or reward it properly.

This creates a fundamental **information asymmetry** between what people know and how capital gets allocated.

### The Solution

NorthFall transforms expert insight into a market built directly on **Kalshi's prediction market APIs**.

Instead of collecting static opinions or research reports, we enable people with real domain knowledge to **put economic weight behind their views** by trading in prediction markets tied to objective, time-bound startup outcomes.

Market prices and positions are programmatically aggregated via Kalshi's APIs into **clear, investor-ready rankings** that surface stronger opportunities earlier.

> **Our goal isn't to replace judgment or diligence** — it's to cut through noise, make high-quality insight visible, and ensure it's worth contributing.

- Revenue targets (e.g., "Will Company Y reach $1M ARR by EOY?")
- Product launches (e.g., "Will Company Z launch their beta by March?")

### 2. **Expert Participation**
Operators, builders, and domain insiders trade YES/NO positions based on their conviction and knowledge.

### 3. **Social Distribution**
Markets are embedded directly into social feeds via interactive link previews — capturing insight **where it happens**.
